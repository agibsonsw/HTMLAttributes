These are fairly straight-forward HTML attribute completions for 
Sublime Text 2, including many HTML5 attributes.

It includes completion of many standard values. For example, typing 
the letter 'c' in the type="" attribute will complete "checkbox". 
If you Backspace and enter the letter 't' it will be replaced 
with "text". (I haven't included "text/css" or "text/javascript" 
for the type attribute, as these are normally supplied within a 
default snippet or completion for script or link.)

There are two versions for some boolean attributes. For example:
CHECKED, or 
checked="checked"

Depending on your settings you may need to press Ctrl-Space to 
display the completions within an opening HTML-tag.
